# Uncovering-Browser-Storage

There were questions about ‘IndexedDB’ where it could've been used I couldn't answer and here are a couple of examples:
- Vim Online: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34262825
- Minimal Password Manager: https://gitlab.com/Compro-Prasad/minimal-password-manager
- Tool for storing data locally PR switching to IndexedDB: https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/1643

Lots of materials about storing data locally: https://localfirstweb.dev and interesting header `Clear-Site-Data` (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Clear-Site-Data)
